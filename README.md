# Small_Business_Website-
For coding challenege 07 I created a fake business called Connor's Bagel Shop. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a homepage for the fake business. The wesbite has a hero section with a headline and descprtion with a nagigation menu that would be linked to diffrent parts of the website such as a services section that offers fresh bagels, fresh coffee, and catering with a footer of the contact details. One important element that I added was CTA (call-to-action) updater, where a person would be able to create new headline that would update the main hero messages using JavaScript and DOM. The style.css sheet was created with the though of cool colors that would be welcoming and also has a Flexbox for layout and media queries. It also has styles that when hovering over the buttons it lifts to give the website a nice touch to the style.
